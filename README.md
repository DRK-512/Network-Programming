# Network-Programming
This repository will consist of network based projects I plan to write in C++
Resources: 
- [Beej's Guide to Network Programming](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/split/)

## Project List
- Create a port scanner
- Create a network scanner that can identify all devices connected to a local network, including the devices IP and MAC addresses
- Create an application to send an email using GET and POST
- Create an application that can send text messages
- HTTP proxy with TCP client
- Develop a network security tool that can detect and prevent ARP spoofing, DDos attacks, and more
- Create a network application where users can post messages
	- The users should be able to participate in the chat room by identifying the IP address
	- Through the dialog box, the user will display the information
	- This should be posted as a port on your IP, and other devices on your network should be able to access it
- Develop a VPN that allows users to securly access a network from a remote location 
	- Might include some sort of server running on your end
