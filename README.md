# Network-Programming
This repository will consist of network based projects I plan to write in C++
This readme will be changed as time passes, and will reflect the project I intend on implementing or already have implemented

## Implemented Project List
### Port-Scanner
- This program will spit out all open ports from a given IP
## Network-Scanner
- This program will spit out all IPs, MAC Addresses, and hostnames from a given network interface, and subnet

## Backburner Project List
- Create an application to send an email using GET and POST
- Create an application that can send text messages
- HTTP proxy with TCP client
- Develop a network security tool that can detect and prevent ARP spoofing, DDos attacks, and more
- Create a network application where users can post messages
	- The users should be able to participate in the chat room by identifying the IP address
	- Through the dialog box, the user will display the information
	- This should be posted as a port on your IP, and other devices on your network should be able to access it
- Develop a VPN that allows users to securly access a network from a remote location 
	- Might include some sort of server running on your end
