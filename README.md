# Network-Programming
This repository will consist of network based projects I plan to write in C++
Resources: 
- [Beej's Guide to Network Programming](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/split/)

## Project List
- Create a port scanner
- Create a network scanner that can identify all devices connected to a local network, including the devices IP and MAC addresses
- Develop a VPN that allows users to securly access a network from a remote location 
- Create a network traffic monitoring tool that can capture and analyze network packets in real-time
- Implement a simple FTP or SFTP or SCP to transfer files between computers
- Create a server to act as a listener socket, and create a client to act as a talker
- Build a simple chat application that uses peer-to-peer networking to allow users to communicate with each other directly
- Build a DS server that can resolve domain names or IP addresses, and implement a simple cache to improve its performace 
- Implement a network-based multiplayer game that allows players to connect and play together over the internet
- Develop a network security tool that can detect and prevent ARP spoofing, DDos attacks, and more
- Create a wireless sensor network and collect data from multiple sensor nodes, then transmit the data to central server for analysis
- Develop a mobile application that uses cellular network to communicate with a server in order to perform certain actions 
- Create an application to send an email using GET and POST
- HTTP proxy with TCP client  
- Create a network application where users can post messages
	- The users should be able to participate in the chat room by identifying the IP address
	- Through the dialog box, the user will display the information
- Implement TCP/IP Stack 
- Network Desktop ManagerÂ 
	- Connect two or more computers to communicate with each other
	- Should be able to access the configuration settings of desktops to determine the reception of updates
	- This ensures that all of the computers are working efficiently and securely
	- The admin should be able to conduct desktop sharing, port scanning, and desktop locking
